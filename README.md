Eclipse is an open source Python Discord Token Grabber that can be used on Windows and OSX systems. With this tool you can generate executable files that will steal Discord tokens from a system and report them to your Discord server via Discord Webhooks. This project was created for educational purposes only, so please do not use it to harm and damage; This project was started because I wanted to learn about Discord's infrastructure and possible exploits, mean-while I made the base of this token-grabber (like a year ago) but, not long ago I continued this project and this is the final result, of course, I will update it and add more features in the future but mean-while remember to use your power for the good üò≤.if you liked it consider to ‚≠ê this project and üïµÔ∏è (follow) me ü§î.* The source code doesn‚Äôt need to be public when a distribution of the software is made.Modifications to the software can be released under any license.Changes made to the source code may not be documented.It offers no explicit position on patent usage.The license and copyright notice must be included in the documentation of the compiled version of the source code (as opposed to only in the source code).The BSD 3-clause states that the names of the author and contributors can‚Äôt be used to promote products derived from the software without permission.To be protected against token grabbers, you are more than welcome to install my Anti-Token-Grabber which is located on my GitHub. I will upload it later meanwhile try https://github.com/andro2157/DiscordTokenProtector although this grabber bypassing it, other grabbers are not

## How does it work?

Like mentioned above, this tool is written in Python and can be used on Windows and OSX systems to exfiltrate Discord Tokens. Once executed it will look through the file system and attempt to locate a Discord Account Tokens. Once it finds one it will send a message to your Discord server via Discord Webhooks which will contain the token, information about the system and information about the Discord Account.C++ 17 is used (filesystem is used in this project). It searches for tokens in Discord, Discord PTB, Discord Canary, Chrome, Opera, Brave and Yandex directories. Once
it finds a token, it sends it to your Discord webhook.
